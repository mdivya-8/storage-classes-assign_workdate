1.REGISTER 
-> Register can store in local varabile.
-> register can not be used in the global scope.

2.register can not store the address of another variable.
ex:#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
    int a=20;
    register int b=70;
    printf("%d %d",a,b);
    printf("%u %u",&a,&b);//error:address of register variable b is requested
}


3.can static varabiles declar in header files?
-> yes static variables can declared in global.

4.where are static variables store?
-> initialized static and global variables will get stored in initialized data segment
ex:static int a=10;
->uninitialized static and global variables will get stored in unintialized data segment
ex:static int a;
->constant initialized static variables will get stored in initialized read only segment
ex:constant static int i=10;
->constant uninitialized static variables will get stored in uninitialized read only segment
ex:constant static int i;

5.const static int a ;
int a=10;
where is a stored?
->>constant uninitialized static variables will get stored in uninitialized(bss) read only segment
6.what is the difference between .obj and .exe ?
-> the main difference between object file and executable file is that an object file is a file generated after compiling
the source code while an executable file is a file generated after linking a set of object files together using a linker.

7.what is the difference between signed char and unsigned char ?
signed char and unsigned char both are used to store single character .so for signed char it can store value from -128 to +127,and the 
unsigned char will store 0 to 255. the basic values are in range of 0 to 127.

8.what is optimization?
-> optimization is a program transformation technique, which tires to improve the code by making it consumes less resorce (i.e. CPU, memory)
and deliver high speed. 

9.what is the maximum possible number in enum?
-> enum values are represented internally as intergers.
-> the range of interger is 0 to 65535.

11. program to write comma operater?
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int a,b;
	a = 10,20,30;//here the value of a is 10,because = has more priority than comma(,)
	b = (10,20,30);// here the value of b is 30,because(=)when multiple values are given with comma operator within braces,
                       the right most value is considered as result of expression. 
	//printing the values
	printf("a= %d, b= %d\n",a,b);
	return 0;
}

12. program to write own implementation of size of operator?
   void main()
{
int a;
char b;
float c;
printf("%d %d %d",sizeof(a),sizeof(b),sizeof(c));
}
